# Bookmark-Manager-Plus


As an active user of this awesome chrome extension, I maintain this fork project to ensure the extension continues to work for as long as I use it. 

The extension is not (yet) published, so for now please follow the [official instruction to use it in Unpacked mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).

Bug reports and feedback are welcomed. Due to limited resource, feature requests will not be handled. 


To support my work, please refer to the following:
